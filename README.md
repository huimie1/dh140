# DH140
## 王悠 Wang You 
This is a course about coding, esp. Python.
I would like to use this course as an opportunity to enrich the DH component of my dissertation, so the final project should be something about a chapter of it.
I expect to be familiar with Python for historical research purpose during this course.
